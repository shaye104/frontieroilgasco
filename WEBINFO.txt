DATA FLOW
- Landing page imports company data from `assets/js/modules/company-data.js` and renders cards/stats via `renderHomeContent`.
- Application form validates client-side inputs, displays status messages, and stores submissions in localStorage as `frontierApplications`.
- Intranet login starts Discord OAuth2 at `/api/auth/discord/start` and enforces access by Discord role membership.
- Cloudflare Pages Functions in `functions/api/auth/*` exchange Discord auth code, verify guild roles, and issue a signed session cookie.
- Shared feedback UI is handled in `assets/js/modules/notice.js`.

MAINTENANCE WORKFLOW
- Regenerate this file at any time using: `npm run webinfo`.
- If git hooks are enabled, this file auto-updates on every commit through `.githooks/pre-commit`.
- For AI handoff, read this file first, then inspect referenced module files.

DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- Primary repo target: https://github.com/shaye104/frontieroilgasco
- Cloudflare deployment command: `echo ok` when using Git-connected Pages deployments.
- Static hosting is configured in `wrangler.jsonc` with `pages_build_output_dir` set to `.`.
- Pages Functions auto-deploy with site code from `functions/`.
- After deploy, attach your custom domain in Cloudflare and complete DNS routing.

SECURITY NOTE
- Configure secure environment variables before production OAuth use: DISCORD_CLIENT_ID, DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET, DISCORD_GUILD_ID, DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN, DISCORD_ALLOWED_ROLE_IDS, SESSION_SECRET, and optional DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI.
