DATA FLOW
- Landing page imports company data from `assets/js/modules/company-data.js` and renders cards/stats via `renderHomeContent`.
- Application form validates client-side inputs, displays status messages, and stores submissions in localStorage as `frontierApplications`.
- Intranet login performs front-end demo authentication using local credentials in `assets/js/modules/intranet-login.js`.
- Shared feedback UI is handled in `assets/js/modules/notice.js`.

MAINTENANCE WORKFLOW
- Regenerate this file at any time using: `npm run webinfo`.
- If git hooks are enabled, this file auto-updates on every commit through `.githooks/pre-commit`.
- For AI handoff, read this file first, then inspect referenced module files.

DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- Primary repo target: https://github.com/shaye104/frontieroilgasco
- Cloudflare Pages deployment: connect the GitHub repo in Workers & Pages and deploy as a static site.
- Recommended Pages build settings: Framework preset `None`, Build command blank, Build output directory `.`.
- After deploy, attach your custom domain in the Pages project and complete DNS routing in Cloudflare.

SECURITY NOTE
- The intranet page is front-end demo logic only. Replace demo auth with a real backend identity service before production use.
